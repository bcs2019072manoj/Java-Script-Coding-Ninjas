Send Feedback
You have already completed the email validation program using "||" operator.

Now modify the code and rewrite the conditions to validate the email using the "&&" operator.



Objectives

Additionally, include one more condition that:
Email  should have at least 3 characters before “@.”
If the email is valid then store the value of email in the result variable with a message.


Example: result = " xyz@gmail.com is valid"
otherwise store "invalid email" in the result variable.
